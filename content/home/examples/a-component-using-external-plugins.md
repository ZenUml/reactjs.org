title: Async message
order: 3

Normal messages in will produce message bars on the lifeline. A message bar 
represents a duration of the execution. If you would like to present only a
message from one participant to another, async message gives you more flexibility.

In an `async-message` sentence (e.g. `Alice->Bob: How are your?`),
you need to provide the source participant (`Alice`), the target participant
(`Bob`) and the message (`the message`).
